Project Description:

1. ToDoList Class:

The ToDoList class serves as the core of the to-do list application.

It has three methods:
__init__(self): Initializes an empty list to store tasks.

add_task(self, task): Adds a new task to the list and prints a confirmation message.

view_tasks(self): Displays all tasks in the list, numbered for easy reference.

2. Main Program (main() Function):
The main() function is the entry point of the program.

It creates an instance of the ToDoList class to manage tasks.

A loop runs until the user decides to quit the application.

The user is presented with a menu of options:

Option 1: Add Task - Prompts the user to input a task and adds it to the to-do list.

Option 2: View Tasks - Displays all tasks in the to-do list.

Option 3: Complete Task - Asks the user for the index of a task to mark as completed.

Option 4: Quit - Exits the program.

3. Running the Program:

The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures that the main() function is executed when the script is run.

Users interact with the program through the console, entering numerical choices to perform different actions.

The program validates user input to ensure it corresponds to a valid menu option.

How to Use:

Run the script in a Python environment.
Follow the on-screen instructions to add tasks, view tasks, complete tasks, or quit the program.
The program provides a simple way to manage a to-do list through the console.
